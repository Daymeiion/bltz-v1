## 🔍 Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Platform Revenue (BLTZ's 10%)
```sql
-- Total platform revenue
SELECT SUM(amount) as total_bltz_revenue
FROM platform_revenue;

-- Monthly trends
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(calculation_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
  SUM(amount) as monthly_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT video_id) as videos
FROM platform_revenue
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

### 2. Publisher Revenue (Schools/Leagues 15%)
```sql
-- Revenue by publisher
SELECT 
  publisher_name,
  publisher_type,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT video_id) as videos,
  COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as players
FROM publisher_revenue
GROUP BY publisher_name, publisher_type
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Top 20 schools by revenue
SELECT 
  publisher_name as school,
  SUM(amount) as school_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as players_count
FROM publisher_revenue
WHERE publisher_type = 'school'
GROUP BY publisher_name
ORDER BY school_revenue DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. Player Earnings Distribution
```sql
-- Total player earnings across platform
SELECT 
  SUM(total_earnings) as all_player_earnings,
  AVG(total_earnings) as avg_per_player,
  COUNT(*) as total_players_earning
FROM player_earnings;

-- Top 100 earners
SELECT 
  p.full_name,
  p.school,
  pe.total_earnings,
  pe.earnings_from_own_videos,
  pe.earnings_from_team_pool,
  ROUND((pe.earnings_from_team_pool / NULLIF(pe.total_earnings, 0) * 100), 2) as team_pool_percentage
FROM player_earnings pe
JOIN players p ON pe.player_id = p.id
ORDER BY pe.total_earnings DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### 4. Team Pool Effectiveness
```sql
-- Team pool distribution stats
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT recipient_player_id) as players_receiving_from_pool,
  SUM(amount) as total_team_pool_distributed,
  AVG(amount) as avg_per_distribution,
  COUNT(*) as total_distributions
FROM revenue_distributions
WHERE distribution_type = 'team_pool';

-- Most generous teams (distributing most to teammates)
SELECT 
  sp.full_name as video_owner,
  sp.school,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rd.video_id) as videos_with_pool,
  SUM(rd.amount) as total_distributed_to_teammates,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rd.recipient_player_id) as teammates_helped
FROM revenue_distributions rd
JOIN players sp ON rd.source_player_id = sp.id
WHERE rd.distribution_type = 'team_pool'
GROUP BY sp.id, sp.full_name, sp.school
ORDER BY total_distributed_to_teammates DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🚨 Important Monitoring

### Health Checks
```sql
-- Ensure all videos have proper splits
SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.title,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pr.id) as has_publisher_rev,
  COUNT(DISTINCT plat.id) as has_platform_rev,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rd.id) as has_player_rev
FROM videos v
LEFT JOIN publisher_revenue pr ON v.id = pr.video_id
LEFT JOIN platform_revenue plat ON v.id = plat.video_id
LEFT JOIN revenue_distributions rd ON v.id = rd.video_id
WHERE v.visibility = 'public'
  AND (pr.id IS NULL OR plat.id IS NULL OR rd.id IS NULL)
GROUP BY v.id, v.title;

-- Find videos missing revenue calculations
SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.title,
  v.created_at,
  COALESCE(view_count, 0) as views
FROM videos v
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as view_count FROM views WHERE video_id = v.id
) vc ON true
LEFT JOIN platform_revenue pr ON v.id = pr.video_id
WHERE v.visibility = 'public'
  AND pr.id IS NULL
  AND v.created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY v.created_at DESC;
```

### Revenue Reconciliation
```sql
-- Verify 100% distribution per video
SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.title,
  (
    COALESCE((SELECT SUM(amount) FROM revenue_distributions WHERE video_id = v.id), 0) +
    COALESCE((SELECT amount FROM publisher_revenue WHERE video_id = v.id), 0) +
    COALESCE((SELECT amount FROM platform_revenue WHERE video_id = v.id), 0)
  ) as total_distributed,
  (
    COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM views WHERE video_id = v.id), 0) * 0.05 +
    COALESCE((v.meta->>'sponsor_amount')::decimal, 0)
  ) as expected_total
FROM videos v
WHERE v.visibility = 'public'
HAVING total_distributed != expected_total
LIMIT 100;
```
