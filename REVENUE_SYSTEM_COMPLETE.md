## 💡 How It Works

### Step 1: Video Gets Views

Video gets 10,000 views over time
Total view revenue: $500 (10,000 × $0.05)
```

### Step 2: Player Tags Teammates
```
Tags 3 teammates from UCLA (2019-2023)
All have overlapping years with owner (2020-2024)
All eligible for team pool
```

### Step 3: Revenue Calculation Runs
```
Total: $500
├─ Player (60%): $300
├─ Team Pool (15%): $75
│  ├─ Teammate 1: $25
│  ├─ Teammate 2: $25
│  └─ Teammate 3: $25
├─ Publisher - UCLA (15%): $75
└─ BLTZ Platform (10%): $50
```

### Step 4: Everyone Gets Paid
```
✅ Player earns $300
✅ 3 teammates each earn $25
✅ UCLA receives $75
✅ BLTZ receives $50
✅ Total: $500 distributed
```
